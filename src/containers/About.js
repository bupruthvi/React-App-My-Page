      When two brothers find a camera, what better name could we keep other than Brocko Photography? Photography is our passion and by work we are software developers. Whenever we get free time from our busy schedule, we go out and make use of time by capturing the beautiful moments.

One of our photographer, Harish Kumar, is a Solutions architect and our another photographer, Pruthvi Raj Gowda, is a Front end developer. Both of them are very creative and technically strong. So what is Brocko Photography ? Its a unique platform where a technology meets photography to create something amazing.
